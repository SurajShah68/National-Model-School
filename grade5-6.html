    <p>Early adolescence is crucial in a child’s academic, social, and emotional development. Children learn independence and responsibility while still needing support and guidance. Our Middle School offers a caring environment where children can safely grow academically, develop study and organizational skills, and explore their interests.
        <br><br>
        Middle School faculty craft courses to strengthen organizational skills, study habits, and critical-thinking capabilities unique to early adolescence. Physical education, study support classes, religious studies class, and arts electives augment mathematics, literature, grammar/writing, science, history, and world languages. Our Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) classes and advisories build opportunities for reflection, goal-setting, and character development into the curriculum. 
        <br><br>
        Middle school students also explore options outside of the set curriculum. Students can choose to participate in band or chorus, join a club like Junior Classical League or Morning Announcements, or pursue leadership opportunities at the school through the Titan Ambassador program or by running for a position on our Student Council.

          Fifth Grade is the first year of middle school at St. Timothy’s School. With scaffolded support, our students begin developing independence as learners. They can choose their arts elective – drama, art, or photography – and they follow a rotating schedule for the first time.
          <br><br>
          An important piece of the fifth-grade program is Toolbox classes.  These classes help students practice skills that will help them in their middle school studies and beyond. Students take study skills, social and emotional learning (SEL), and research skills.
          <br><br>
          Fifth-grade students receive a personal Chromebook for the first time and learn appropriate use and other digital citizenship rules in technology class. 
          <br><br>
          We also enjoy several social opportunities with our fifth-grade students, including a field games activity in the fall, a social activity in the spring, and a spring field trip.

          Our sixth-grade program supports students as they develop consistency in their work and add depth to their learning. Striving to strengthen and build on the community established in Lower School and in fifth grade, sixth-grade teachers and students create and reinforce bonds through collaborative work and community-building field trips.
          <br><br>
          Students take a trimester of Spanish and an introductory semester of Latin for world language exposure. The following year, students will have the opportunity to choose between the languages for seventh and eighth grades.
          <br><br>
          In addition to their fine arts elective and study support classes, students take a trimester-long enrichment class designed by their core teachers. These classes include STEM, Create, and Community Connections.
          <br><br>
          Social and emotional learning (SEL) in sixth grade is focused on self-reflective behaviors and the development of positive group dynamics. Sixth-grade students also participate in Religious Studies, a class that focuses on the traditions of Christianity. These two classes are the base for much of the service work undertaken during sixth grade. Both provide an opportunity for students to reflect on projects and build context around their work.
          <br><br>
          For many students, the highlight of the sixth-grade year is the community-building trip to the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly outside of Asheville. This trip includes many team-building activities to strengthen their bond as a cohort. We enjoy several other social opportunities with our sixth-grade students, including a field games activity in the fall.
