    <p>Children lay the groundwork to become lifelong learners from a young age. Our Lower School offers an academically challenging, age-appropriate program that builds confident and caring learners. We introduce our students to a broad spectrum of experiences with small classes, a high degree of personal, differentiated attention. 
        <br><br>
       Our teachers understand the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual needs of each student in a child-centered environment. Our research-based curriculum encourages students to develop independence, creativity, problem-solving abilities, perseverance, and confidence. We promote curiosity, discovery, and community in the classroom and through opening and closing meetings, co-curricular classes (Music, Spanish, Science Lab, Imagination Lab, Movement, PE, Art, Media) as well as outside the classroom in our school learning garden and on class field trips. A daily moment of prayer and weekly Chapel services provide spiritual education, and our Character Education program promotes the theological virtues of faith, hope and love.
        <br><br> 
       As they complete their lower school years, students begin to see themselves as capable individuals who use their gifts and talents for the good of others, armed with the key skills to excel in Middle School and beyond.

          In first grade, we foster the unique potential of each child. Our program incorporates opportunities for social and academic learning and growth through research-based, whole class, individual, partner, and small group instruction. We believe the social curriculum is as important as the academic one and that students learn best when they feel included and safe in their classroom community.

          In second grade, students participate in engaging instruction that encourages a love of learning which allows for personal, academic, and spiritual growth. We provide a classroom environment that supports the diverse learning styles of our students.

          In third grade, we continue to build on a strong academic foundation and foster independence. We encourage students to be curious and motivated to learn. As third graders become more sophisticated in their thinking, abstract concepts, inferring, problem solving, and critical thinking skills are emphasized as they apply existing skills to new situations. Third grade is a pivotal year of self-discovery and tremendous social, emotional, spiritual, and academic growth.
